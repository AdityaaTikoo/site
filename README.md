# About this site 

- This is a personal site that is made using a static website builder called [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) written in the `go` programming language.
- I have modified luke smith's [theme](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lugo).
- This website is a mixture of [fury999's site](https://fury999io.github.io/) and [lukesmith's site](https://lukesmith.xyz/).

## Issues 
Here are some common issues that are currently present in my website.
1. Not all links work and will give a `404` error.
2. For some reason my custom `courier new` font does not work on mobile devices rather it uses some ugly font.
3. `Previous` and `Next` Buttons don't work properly.

## Specification
- For Main heading color and font size, I'm using `#bfff80` and `45px` respectively.
- For other `h1` heading, I'm using `#ccc` and `40px`.
- For `h2`, I'm using the same `#ccc` color and decrease the font-size by `5px` (i.e `35px`).
- For links, I'm using `rgb(70, 163, 86)` color and `20px` as the font-size.
- For my `font-family`, I'm using `courier new`.

## Important Note ! 
1. I am currently hosting this website using `github pages`, I will switch to a VPS once my exams are over, so this repo will be archived !
2. If you wish to host your own website using `github pages` then be aware that your links won't properly work until you connect your website to a `domain` !

## Learn More
- If you wish to learn more about hugo, then I reccomend watching [Luke Smith's Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZFL09qhKi5I&t=1822s) on it and by reading the docs, you will be good to go.
